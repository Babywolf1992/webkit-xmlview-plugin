Known Issues:

- "Use Selection For Find" doesn't work. The takeFindStringFromSelection method never reaches the main view on the responder chain. The text view seems to handle it, but in a way that doesn't actually set the find clipboard.


Todo:

- Fallback to Safari in some cases, e.g. Google Calendar
  - blacklist?
