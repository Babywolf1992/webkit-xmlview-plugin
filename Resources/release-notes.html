<a name="version-1.7"></a>
<h1>Version 1.7</h1>

<ul>
	<li>CSS tweaks related to collapsed elements. Note that you must restore the default CSS code with the Reset button to get the new version if you have previously customized the code.</li>
</ul>

<a name="version-1.6"></a>
<h1>Version 1.6</h1>

<ul>
	<li>The default JavaScript code now lets you Option-click on a tag name to recursively collapse/expand all child elements. This is useful if you Option-click first to collapse deeply and then do a regular click on the same element to expand again. This will leave all childs collapsed. This often helps when viewing big documents with long lists. Note that you must restore the default JavaScript code with the Reset button to get the new version if you have previously customized the code.</li>
	<li>JavaScript errors and exceptions are now displayed, making debugging easier.</li>
	<li>Using the <code>alert()</code> function in JavaScript customization code shows the alert message in an alert sheet in addition to logging it to the system console.</li>
	<li>Preferences and About panels are now closed when the XML page is closed or reloaded, preventing orphaned or duplicate windows.</li>
	<li>Undo now works in the CSS and JS text boxes.</li>
</ul>

<a name="version-1.5"></a>
<h1>Version 1.5</h1>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>There is a new formatting view option that colorizes the XML:</p>

		<p><img src='http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/xmlviewplugin/view-formatted-styled.png'/></p>

		<p>This view is interactive and lets you click on tag names of elements with mixed content to collapse or expand the children. In the example above, the <code>sub</code> element is collapsed.</p>

		<p>Because this option presents a logical view of the document that does not match the XML data sent by the server byte-for-byte, the two old formatting options, which present the original data more faithfully, are still there. They have been renamed in the action menu, the three options are now called “View Raw”, “View Formatted” and “View Formatted and Styled”.</p>
	</li>

	<li>The new formatting option is based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You get access to the CSS and JavaScript code in a new Preferences dialog where you can customize it according to your needs. Such customization can range from simple syntax coloring color changes to highly interactive mini applications for your particular XML format. I will collect information
	for CSS/JavaScript customization on the <a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/xmlviewplugin/#customization">plugin’s web page</a>.</li>
	
	<li>The Find panel now works in Safari 4 Beta.</li>
</ul>


<a name="version-1.4"></a>
<h1>Version 1.4</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Previous versions sometimes truncated large XML documents, especially when
	loading from a slow server or over a slow connection. The problem is fixed in this version.</li>
</ul>


<a name="version-1.3"></a>
<h1>Version 1.3</h1>

<ul>
	<li>The plugin no longer loads the XML data a second time in a separate HTTP GET request. Instead, it reuses the data already loaded by the browser. This is important if requesting the URL a second time has undesired side effects on the server (which an HTTP GET shouldn’t) or if the URL can only be accessed via a POST instead of a GET request.</li>
	<li>The ⌘-E keyboard shortcut for “Use Selection for Find” now works, it didn’t in previous versions. Unfortunately, picking the command from the menu bar with the mouse still doesn’t work because I can’t intercept that event. That is probably not a common use case anyway.</li>
	<li>Improved the description of the plugin and its MIME types in the list displayed by Help > Installed Plug-ins.</li>
</ul>


<a name="version-1.2"></a>
<h1>Version 1.2</h1>

<ul>
	<li><p>The last auto-update to version 1.1 changed Safari’s proportional font settings. You might have noticed
	smaller fonts on some web sites afterwards, sorry about that. This version fixes the problem for future updates, but
	you have to restore your font settings once after updating to version 1.2. Apple’s default is Times 16, but you might want to pick something nicer while you’re at it.</p>
	<p>The problem was caused by a bug in the auto-update library I use for this plugin. If you’re interested
	in the details, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sparkle/+bug/302886">look here</a>.</p></li>
	<li>The About panel was made editable in 1.1 by mistake. Fixed in this release.</li>
</ul>

<a name="version-1.1"></a>
<h1>Version 1.1</h1>

<ul>
	<li>The Find command for searching text works now.</li>
	<li>Minor tweaks and cleanups</li>
</ul>

<a name="version-1.0"></a>
<h1>Version 1.0</h1>
<ul>
	<li>First public release</li>
</ul>
