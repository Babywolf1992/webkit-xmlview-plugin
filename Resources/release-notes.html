<a name="version-1.4"></a>
<h1>Version 1.4</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Previous versions sometimes truncated large XML documents in some cases, especially when
	loading from a slow server or over a slow connection. The problem is fixed in this version.</li>
</ul>

<a name="version-1.3"></a>
<h1>Version 1.3</h1>

<ul>
	<li>The plugin no longer loads the XML data a second time in a separate HTTP GET request. Instead, it reuses the data already loaded by the browser. This is important if requesting the URL a second time has undesired side effects on the server (which an HTTP GET shouldn’t) or if the URL can only be accessed via a POST instead of a GET request.</li>
	<li>The ⌘-E keyboard shortcut for “Use Selection for Find” now works, it didn’t in previous versions. Unfortunately, picking the command from the menu bar with the mouse still doesn’t work because I can’t intercept that event. That is probably not a common use case anyway.</li>
	<li>Improved the description of the plugin and its MIME types in the list displayed by Help > Installed Plug-ins.</li>
</ul>

<a name="version-1.2"></a>
<h1>Version 1.2</h1>

<ul>
	<li><p>The last auto-update to version 1.1 changed Safari’s proportional font settings. You might have noticed
	smaller fonts on some web sites afterwards, sorry about that. This version fixes the problem for future updates, but
	you have to restore your font settings once after updating to version 1.2. Apple’s default is Times 16, but you might want to pick something nicer while you’re at it.</p>
	<p>The problem was caused by a bug in the auto-update library I use for this plugin. If you’re interested
	in the details, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sparkle/+bug/302886">look here</a>.</p></li>
	<li>The About panel was made editable in 1.1 by mistake. Fixed in this release.</li>
</ul>

<a name="version-1.1"></a>
<h1>Version 1.1</h1>

<ul>
	<li>The Find command for searching text works now.</li>
	<li>Minor tweaks and cleanups</li>
</ul>

<a name="version-1.0"></a>
<h1>Version 1.0</h1>
<ul>
	<li>First public release</li>
</ul>
